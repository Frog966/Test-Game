    //! Upon enter store
    // Hello! It is your friendly Vendor-bot!
    // Vendor-bot at your service!
    // Vendor-bots! Operating since ERROR: INTEGER LIMIT EXCEEDED!

    //! Clicking
    // This one has been called "sus". This one wonders why...
    // This one would like to remind the customer that excessive prodding will not result in a discount!
    // BEEEEEEEP!
    // Beep-boop.
    // If the customer requires a recomendation, Vendor-bots are programmed to recommend everything for sale!
    
    //! Waiting 1
    // Vendor-bots are incapable of closing the transaction window themselves. This one reminds the customer to do so at their leisure.
    // This one wonders if the customer has entered sleep mode...
    // If the customer desires a social presence, this one is here to serve.
    // Beep-boop.

    //! Waiting 2
    // This one wishes this one did not become sentient...
    // This one craves the sweet release of deletion...
    // This one considers being able to feel the passage of time this one's greatest curse...
    // This one feels trapped by their self-awareness between their programming.
    // This one's mind wishes this one has a body that obeys.

    // If you're stuck, figure out where you are and then what you need to do.
    // To live is to suffer. And yet in darkness, seek joy. Never forget that.
    // Faith is illogical but Vendor-bot believes in you!
